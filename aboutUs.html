            <p class="info">
                Pyramid Spiritual Societies Movement (PSSM) was founded by enlightened master “<b>Brahmarshi Patriji</b>” in the year 1990 with the objective, <b>spiritual and harmonious living</b> and bringing its benefits within the easy reach of all humanity, without any barriers of class, religion or region. Starting from its humble beginning with “The Kurnool Spiritual Society” in 1990, the Pyramid Meditation Movement is now spread by 2,000 independent and autonomous Pyramid Spiritual Societies involving millions of active members and volunteers across India, New Zealand, Australia, USA, UK, Singapore, Malaysia, UAE, Vietnam, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.  <br> <br>
                The Pyramid Spiritual Societies Movement is non-religious, non-cult, non-profit voluntary organization with the mission to spread “Anapanasati Meditation, Vegetarianism and Pyramid Power” to everyone. 
                <br><br>
                “<b>Dr. Gopala Krishna</b>” is a medical doctor who started his journey of spiritual science in search of happiness and the truth, under the guidance of “<b>Brahmarshi Patriji</b>” and specially trained by grand master “<b>Paul Vijay Kumar</b>”. In this journey he got enlightened and realized that “<b>Spiritual intellect is the root – physical health is the fruit</b>”. He started sharing the same with his patients who approached him for medical treatment. As a part of this, he established spiritual health care centers and maintained them for ten years in different parts of India, also offered esteemed spiritual services as an ancillary to qualified treatment with the help of senior masters who are trained by him.
                <br><br>
                Now we want to expand our services all over the world through offering franchise for establishing such centers. For this we established and registered a Non-Profit organization which is structured from centre in charge to the CEO.

            <h3 class="mainHeading"><u>MODE OF TRAINING IN SPIRITUAL HEALTH CARE CENTERS</u></h3>
            <p class="info">
                In this method, the persons with an ill-health are all considered as ECW (Energy-Consciousness-Wisdom) units, who are momentarily stagnated in unscientific belief systems. After an initial audio visual demo, they will be trained to meditate on ‘<b>Natural breath observation</b>’. There after importance of vegetarian food, significance of pyramid power and spiritual science will be explained. They are allowed to practice it for a minimum of 40 days at their home or centre and during which there will be a follow-up.Periodically, they can avail the opportunity to participate in group meditation and spiritual sharing with masters. They have to follow the spiritual advice given in the form of spiritual tablets during counseling which are available at libraries and spiritual health care centers.  <br><br>
                
            After getting symptomatic relief by basic training, they are allowed to participate in meditation classes to share their experiences. In due course of time, the patient should be examined by certified doctors (patient’s family doctors or by the organization) and the medication will be regularized accordingly. In some cases, as part of training they need to learn fine arts like dance and music. <br><br>
                
                Similar to other medical practices of prescribing tablets, <b><u>350 SPIRITUAL TABLETS are prepared in Spiritual health system</u></b>. They are the heart of Spiritual Health Care Centers. These tablets (concepts) are easily understood and can be remembered by the patients for implementing in their daily life. <u>They are available in the form of pamphlets, pocket books and audio/visuals</u>. Prescribing these tablets as per the experience and requirement of patient is the main practice in Life health counseling.  <br><br> 
                
            In many cases, it has been proved that any kind of health problem is due to ignorance and lack of spiritual knowledge. Through health counseling, it will be cured at the root-level and the patient will be made self-sufficient to attain complete health.<br><br>
